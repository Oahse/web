use short polling i the suppliers and admin pages for specific ui changes. this is used only when the supplier ot the admin has the tab open. in case of any erro have a wait time


==============
8. observabilty from day one
use structured logging
request IDs
kafak consumer lag monitoring
db slow query logs
error tracking

9. deployment and scaling tips 
dockerize evrthing
horizoanaly scal fastapi
scale kafka consumers idependently
cloudflare cdn for images
read replicas when needed
==================


11. Founder advice
solve logistics and payments before tech perfection
do not over engineering searching for products, categories etc. keep it simple
tech is realy the bottle neck
build for correctness first, speed second
customers forgive slownees not wrong charges
ship features users ask for

add metrics founders actualy needed
write down "payment gateway down"
write down "orders stcuk in pending"
write down "kafka lag exploding"
write down "inventory mismatch detected"
backend apis(avoid spikes)
-checkout success rate
-payment failure rate
-order -> payment latency
-inventory mismatch count
-kafka consumer lag per topic


12. risks:
redis cahche hit rate look out

13. scaling(only when needed) roadmap
1. pahse 1(now)
-single fastapi service
-kafka for async
-vertical db scaling
2. phase 2(tracton)
-reaed replicas
-split consumers by domain
-cdn eerywhere
3. phase 3(real scale)
-extract inventory or search service
-dedicated analytics pipeline
-separate payment domain
