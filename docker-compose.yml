  # PostgreSQL Database (Alpine)
  # This service sets up the PostgreSQL database.
  # The 'environment' section configures the database name, user, and password for initial setup.
  # 'ports' maps the container's PostgreSQL port to the host machine.
  # 'volumes' ensures data persistence across container restarts.
  # 'healthcheck' verifies the database is ready for connections.
