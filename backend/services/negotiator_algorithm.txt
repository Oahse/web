## Negotiation Algorithm (negotiator.py) - Summary

This document describes a simple iterative negotiation algorithm implemented in `negotiator.py`.
The core idea involves two agents, a `Buyer` and a `Seller`, each with a `target_price`, a `limit_price`, and a `negotiation style` that dictates their `concession_rate`.

The `NegotiationEngine` orchestrates the process in rounds, where both the buyer and seller make offers or counter-offers, gradually moving towards each other based on their defined styles and limits. The negotiation concludes when an offer from one party meets or exceeds the demand of the other, or vice-versa, indicating a mutually acceptable price has been found within their boundaries.

This model simulates a dynamic haggling process aiming for deal closure.
