## **Negotiation Algorithm (English Pseudocode)**

1. **Define an Agent (Buyer or Seller)**

   * Each agent has:

     * A name
     * A target price (what they ideally want)
     * A limit price (the minimum/maximum they are willing to accept)
     * A negotiation style (friendly, aggressive, patient) that determines how much they concede each round

2. **Define a Buyer Agent**

   * To make an offer:

     * Calculate a movement toward the seller’s price based on concession rate
     * Add this movement to the buyer’s target price
     * Ensure the offer does not exceed the buyer’s limit price

3. **Define a Seller Agent**

   * To make a counter-offer:

     * Calculate a movement toward the buyer’s offer based on concession rate
     * Subtract this movement from the seller’s target price
     * Ensure the offer does not go below the seller’s limit price

4. **Define the Negotiation Engine**

   * Keep track of the buyer, seller, current round, whether the negotiation is finished, and the final price

5. **Define a Check for Deal Closure**

   * A deal is considered reached if:

     * The buyer’s offer is equal to or higher than the seller’s offer
     * And the buyer’s offer is not below the buyer’s limit price

6. **Negotiation Step (One Round)**

   * If the negotiation is already finished, do nothing
   * Otherwise, increase the round count
   * **Buyer makes an offer**

     * Check if the deal can be closed with this offer

       * If yes, mark negotiation finished and record final price
   * **Seller makes a counter-offer**

     * Check if the deal can be closed with this offer

       * If yes, mark negotiation finished and record final price
   * If no deal is reached, return the current buyer and seller offers along with the round number

7. **Negotiation Loop**

   * Initialize buyer and seller with their target prices, limits, and styles
   * Initialize the negotiation engine with the buyer and seller
   * Repeat steps:

     * Optionally update buyer or seller prices (e.g., from UI)
     * Perform a negotiation step
     * Display current round results
   * Stop when a deal is reached or a maximum number of rounds is reached


If you want, I can also make a **very short one-page version with a flowchart style**, which is perfect for presentations. Do you want me to do that?
